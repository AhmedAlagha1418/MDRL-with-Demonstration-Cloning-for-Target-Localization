# MDRL-with-Demonstration-Cloning-for-Target-Localization
This code simulates the MDRL-SR and MDRL-DC models in the paper titled "Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Demonstration Cloning for Target Localization".
The contents of this repository are as follows:
* MDRL-DC: the python files required to train and test an MDRL-DC model for the target localization problem.
* MDRL-SR: the python files required to train and test an MDRL-SR model for the target localization problem.
